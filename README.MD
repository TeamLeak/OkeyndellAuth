# OkeyndellAuth

## What it is?
This is the repository for my Spigot plugin. This plugin is light authentication to your server. I'm promoting it as a replacement for AuthMe

## How to use?
Clone or download the repository, then check with yourself for:
- Gradle 7.3+
- Java 16+
- 
If everything is there, write ./gradlew clean shadowJar, copy the assembled jar file to plugins / of your server and test it.
Also, you can download from Releases
